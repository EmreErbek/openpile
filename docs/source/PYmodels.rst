$p$-$y$ formulation
-------------------

General
^^^^^^^

The $p$-$y$ formulation called API sand is based on the work conducted by
O'neill and Murchison (see Ref. /1/).  

The API sand formulation is presented in both the API and DNVGL standards,
see, Ref. /2/ and Ref. /3/.

Equations
^^^^^^^^^

Granular soils are modelled by the sand p-y model as described with the following formula:

![formula01.jpg](_static/API_sand/formula01.jpg)

the coefficients C1, C2, and C3 depend on the friction angle $\phi\prime$ as shown 
in below figure.

The factor A takes into account static and cycling loading and is equal to:

The factor k is the initial modulus of subgrade reaction, which can be 
approximated by the following equation in which the output is given in kN/mÂ³ 
and where $\phi\prime$ is inserted in degrees: 

$k = \max \left(197.8 \cdot \phi\prime^2 - 10232 \cdot \phi\prime + 136820 , 5400 \right)$

The equation is a fit to the recommended values in Ref. /2/.  The correspondence 
of this fit is illustrated in below figure:
